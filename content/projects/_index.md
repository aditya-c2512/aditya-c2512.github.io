## Elektron Engine V2
Elektron Engine V2 is a DirectX11-based 3D Graphics engine I made to learn and implement advanced rendering techniques. Throughout the development of this project, I implemented the following concepts:
- glTF mesh and material loading.
- GGX shading from multiple dynamic point lights.
- Shadow mapping from single dynamix point light.
- Image-based Lighting using HDRi environment maps.
